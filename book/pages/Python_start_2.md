# Getting started after installation

After installing Anaconda and setting up the environment, start the Navigator and select the `optimization environment`. This can be done on the top of the screen at `All application` on  `base (root)`: change `base (root)` to `optimization`. Or in the left tab under `Environments`, click `optimization.`
Then, launch the Jupyter Notebook from the list of applications under `home`, which will open the Jupyter Notebook dashboard in your webbrowser (starting in your Documents folder on Windows and your home directory on a Mac):
```{figure} ./figures/jupyter_notebook_start.png
:name: jupyter_notebook_start
:width: 600px
Jupyter notebook start page
```
Use the dashboard to surf to the directory where you stored your Notebooks (you can only surf to lower directories not higher directories) and click on the one you want to open. Launch a new notebook by clicking on the “New” button and then selecting “Python 3”:

## Working in a Jupyter Notebook
Notebooks consist of cells which can contain code or text/figures (in markdown language). You can choose this cell type for each cell:

```
Both code and text cells can be run by clicking `execute` or pressing `shift + enter`. Code cells run, resulting in a counter between the square brackets, while text cells are just rendered:
