After installing Anaconda, start the Navigator and then launch the Jupyter Notebook, which will open the Jupyter Notebook dashboard in your webbrowser (starting in your Documents folder on Windows and your home directory on a Mac):

Jupyter notebook start page
```
Use the dashboard to surf to the directory where you stored your Notebooks (you can only surf to lower directories not higher directories) and click on the one you want to open. Launch a new notebook by clicking on the “New” button and then selecting “Python 3”:

## Working in a Jupyter Notebook
Notebooks consist of cells which can contain code or text/figures (in markdown language). You can choose this cell type for each cell:

```
Both code and text cells can be run by clicking `execute` or pressing `shift + enter`. Code cells run, resulting in a counter between the square brackets, while text cells are just rendered:
