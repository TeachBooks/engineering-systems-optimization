# Python installation instruction

[Python](https://python.org/) is a popular language for research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its research packages individually can be a bit difficult, so you're recommended to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), an all-in-one installer.

Regardless of how you choose to install it, please make sure you install Python version 3.x (e.g., 3.6 is fine).

We will teach Python using the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), a programming environment that runs in a web browser (Jupyter Notebook will be installed by Anaconda). For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers are all [supported](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#browser-compatibility) (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not). Notebooks can be run after you install Python and the appropriate packages.

## Installation on Windows
1. Open https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section with your web browser.
2. Press the Windows icon below Get Additional Installers
3. Download the Anaconda for Windows installer with Python 3 (If you are not sure which version to choose, you probably want the 64-bit Graphical Installer)
4. Install Python 3 by running the Anaconda Installer, using all of the defaults for installation except make sure to check both Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable and Register Anaconda as my default Python.
